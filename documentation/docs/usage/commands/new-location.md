# Add new location from clipboard

This command will take the text which is currently in your clipboard and add it as a location block to your current note.  
This works currently only with single location coordinates. The coordinates could either be in this format:

```
[51.0414383239025, -113.9957147847538]
```

or without the brackets:

```
51.0414383239025, -113.9957147847538
```
