Welcome to the Obsidian Location Plugin! This plugin allows you to generate location images for your Obsidian notes. You can create a map image of a specific location.

You can simply use the code block with `location` as the language identifier. If you provide then longitude and latitude, the plugin will generate a map image for that location.

## Example Usage

\```location  
Latitude: 44.64266326577057  
Longitude: -63.57530151565183  
\```

## Configuration

To make the plugin work, after installation you are required to add your Mapbox API key into the plugin settings. You can get a free API key from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).
